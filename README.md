I love this script! I want to install it and use it everywhere!

    wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanpcmcquen/image-ultimator/master/imgult; install -m755 imgult /usr/local/bin/; rm imgult


#USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Just run this command in any directory with images, note that it will *OVERWRITE* images and loop recursively through all directories INSIDE the directory you run it in.
